**INTRODUCTION**


A Danang (2015:88) defines that decision making is a cognitive process that
unites memory, thinking, information processing and evaluative judgments. The
situation in which a decision is taken determines the exact nature of the process in
question. The process may take months, with an identifiable series of decisions made
at various stages of the ongoing decision-making process. Purchasing decisions are
actions taken by consumers due to perceived impulses or motives that give rise to

interest or encouragement to fulfill needs. According to (Malau, 2017), the purchasing
decision is the stage where the buyer has determined his choice and made his choice
and purchased the product and consumed it. Decision making by consumers to
purchase a product begins with awareness of their needs and desires. In making
purchasing decisions, consumers are influenced by various factors. According to
(Kotler, 2017) purchasing decisions are an activity of individuals who are directly
involved in obtaining and using the goods offered. Based on the two definitions above,
it can be concluded that purchasing decisions are a main part of consumer behavior
that leads to purchasing products or services. In making a purchasing decision,
consumers cannot be separated from the factors that influence and motivate
consumers to make purchases.

There are a number of factors that can influence purchasing decisions,
including business location and word of mouth. Location is a strategic place where
consumers can reach business places (dining places, shopping centers, etc.) easily,
safely, and have a large parking area. According to (Panca, 2022)Location is a place, a
physical position that has a strategic function because it can help determine the
achievement of a business entity's goals. Location is defined as a distribution channel
for manufacturing industrial products, while location is defined as a place of service
for service industrial products.

According to (Harjadi, 2008)location is a decision made by a company
regarding where its operations and staff will be located. The importance of location
for service companies depends on the type and degree of interaction involved. To
determine this location, companies need to look at the type of consumer interaction
and services provided. The definition of location/place according to (Harjadi, 2008)
is the place where a business or business activity is carried out. Important factors in
business development are the location of the location in urban areas, how to reach it
and the travel time from the location to the destination. The factor of a good location
is relative for each type of business which is different from the definitions above, so it
can be concluded that location is the place where a business operates its business and
its staff to achieve the goals of a business.

According to (Kasmir, 2010), every company has at least four locations which
are considered according to the company's needs, namely: 1). The location for the
head office is the location for controlling the operational activities of the branches. 2).
A location for a factory is a location used to process or produce goods or services. 3).
The location for the building is a place to store company goods for both incoming and
outgoing goods. 4). The location for the branch office is the location for the company's
business activities in serving its consumers. Customer is the level of consumer
feelings after comparing performance or results. what he feels compared to his
expectations(Philip, 2013). From the definition above, it can be concluded that
customer satisfaction is the result of the consumer's assessment that the perceived
product or service can meet the consumer's expectations.

There are a number of studies that show (Fitriyani et al., 2019); (Febriansyah
& Triputra, 2021); (Aprileny et al., 2020); (Hadiansyah & Yanwar, 2017) & (Indah
Saraswati et al., 2023) show a positive relationship and a significant influence on

purchasing decisions. Apart from business location, researchers also believe that the
Word of Mouth variable can influence purchasing decision variables. According to
(Sinaga et al., 2017), word of mouth communication is cheap marketing, using
consumers as promoters for company products and marketing tools for organizations
so there is no need to "pay" for this activity. Word of mouth communication (Word of
Mouth Communication) has a very big influence on a person because the information
obtained is considered real and honest and people tend to trust more product or place
information that they hear from friends, relatives or people closest to them who have
experience with a product. compared to information from advertisements. This will
influence consumer purchasing decisions for a product (Harjadi, 2008).

According to Hasan, WoM is praise, or positive suggestions, comments or
customer testimonials about their personal experiences with services and products
that influence a buyer's decision or their purchasing behavior (Hasan, 2009).
According to Sumardy, WoM is an activity in marketing that can trigger consumers
and can stimulate them to talk about, promote, recommend corporate brands to other
potential consumers (Nawangsari, 2020). WoM Communication, or what is commonly
known as the consumer word-of-mouth communication process, is the initial process
of communication that can provide individual positive comments on a product or
service. Communication that is usually conveyed through mouth to mouth is a
communication activity that is very often used in everyday life. Communication in this
way is very effective in expediting the marketing process and can provide benefits to
the corporation. Communication via WoM does not require large costs because
consumers who are satisfied with a corporation's products or services will spread it
to other consumers (Kotler, 2017). WoM is the overall value of communication from
individual to individual regarding a particular product, service or corporation at one
time (Yayl√≠, 2012).

There are a number of studies that show (Kurniawan & Saputra, 2022);
(Sinaga et al., 2017); (Anggreni & Febrina Hambalah, 2022); (Nugraha et al., 2015)&
(Wibowo et al., 2021)show a positive relationship and a significant influence on
purchasing decisions. Based on the explanation above, it can be concluded that this
research aims to analyze the influence of business location and word of mouth on
purchasing decisions.


**RESEARCH METHODS**


A strategic business location that is close to the target market is one of the
factors that researchers believe can influence consumer purchasing decisions
(Sugiyono, 2019). This close location will make consumers decide to purchase, be
satisfied, and communicate with other consumers to encourage enthusiastic other
consumers to share purchasing decisions with producers who have sales points in
strategic locations(Jonathan Sarwono, 2016). Therefore, this research aims to analyze
the influence of business location and word of mouth on consumer purchasing
decisions. This research is quantitative research with an explanatory approach that
uses a questionnaire method in collecting data(Abdurahman, 2016). The

questionnaire was distributed to Indomaret and Alfamart consumers spread
throughout Indonesia with the criteria of having shopped at least 3 times. The
questionnaire contains statements of agree, strongly agree, disagree, strongly
disagree, and neither agree nor the same on the 16 question items asked(Gujarati,
2013). This data can also be called primary data. These data were analyzed using the
smart PLS 4.0 tool with the following research model:

**Figure 1: Model**

**Noted:**

BL: Business Location

WOM: Word of Mouth

PD: Purchase Decision


**Hypothesis:**

H1: The Influence of Business Location on Purchasse Decision

H2: The Influence of Word of Mouth on Purchasse Decision


**RESULT AND DISCUSSION**


**Validity Test**

The results of the hypothesis and researchers' beliefs above contain two
things, namely the Business Location and Word of Mouth variables which can have a
positive relationship and have a significant influence on purchasing decisions. To
confirm and prove this hypothesis, the initial stage that must be completed is
validating the 16 question items used in this research with the following
results.(Sarstedt et al., 2014):

|Col1|Table 1. Validity Test|Col3|

**Valid : > 0.70**


**Reliability Test**

300 Alfamart and Indomaret consumers with the criteria of having shopped
at least once and having answered the 16 research question items, have been declared
valid because the loading factor value is above 0.70. The next stage is to ensure that
the three variables used in this research pass the reliability test with the following
results (Ghozali, 2016):

**Table 2. Reliability Test**

|Variable|Composite<br>Reliability|Cronbach Alfa|Noted|
|---|---|---|---|
|Business Location|0.841|0.801|Reliable|
|Word of Mouth|0.852|0.812|Reliable|
|Purchase Decision|0.844|0.804|Reliable|


Reliable > 0.70


**Path Coefficient**


Based on the comprehensive results presented in tables 2 and 3 above, 14
question items consisting of 6 question items for the Business Location variable, 6
question items for the Word of Mouth variable, and 4 question items for the Purchase
Decision variable have been declared valid because the loading factor values are in
above 0.70. Furthermore, the values for the three variables Composite Reliability and
Cronbach Alpha are above 0.70 and are declared reliable. The final stage is to find out
the direction of the relationship and the P-Values of the independent variable on the
dependent variable above with the following research results(Gujarati, 2013):


Table 3. Path Coefficient

|Direct Influence|Variable|P-Values|Noted|
|---|---|---|---|
|<br>**Direct Influence**|BL->PD|0.036|Accepted|
|<br>**Direct Influence**|WOM-> PD|0.029|Accepted|

Significant Level > 0.05


The statistical results explained in table 3 of the path coefficient above show
that the Business Location variable can have a positive relationship and a significant
influence on Purchasing Decisions because the P-Values value is positive and is below
the significance level of 0.036. This is in line with the researcher's statement and the
direction of the questionnaire questions above which shows that a strategic business
location can increase purchasing decisions because it is easy to reach, close, and does

not take a lot of time. These results are also in line with research (Fitriyani et al.,
2019); (Febriansyah & Triputra, 2021); (Aprileny et al., 2020); (Hadiansyah &
Yanwar, 2017) & (Indah Saraswati et al., 2023). Thus, the first researcher's hypothesis
and beliefs can be justified and accepted.

Apart from that, the results of the second research hypothesis and beliefs also
show the same results if the Word of Mouth variable has a positive relationship and a
significant influence on Perchase Decision because the P-Values value is positive and
is below the 0.05 significance level, namely 0.029. It is reasoned that word of mouth
or word of mouth communication between consumers can increase purchasing

decisions and enthusiasm between consumers. These results are also in line with

research (Kurniawan & Saputra, 2022); (Sinaga et al., 2017); (Anggreni & Febrina
Hambalah, 2022); (Nugraha et al., 2015)& (Wibowo et al., 2021). Thus the two
hypotheses above are believed to be acceptable.


**CONCLUSION**


The statistical results explained in table 3 of the path coefficient above show
that the Business Location variable can have a positive relationship and a significant
influence on Purchasing Decisions because the P-Values value is positive and is below
the significance level of 0.036. This is in line with the researcher's statement and the
direction of the questionnaire questions above which shows that a strategic business
location can increase purchasing decisions because it is easy to reach, close, and does
not take a lot of time. These results are also in line with research (Fitriyani et al.,
2019); (Febriansyah & Triputra, 2021); (Aprileny et al., 2020); (Hadiansyah &
Yanwar, 2017) & (Indah Saraswati et al., 2023). Thus, the first researcher's hypothesis
and beliefs can be justified and accepted.

Apart from that, the results of the second research hypothesis and beliefs also
show the same results if the Word of Mouth variable has a positive relationship and a
significant influence on Perchase Decision because the P-Values value is positive and
is below the 0.05 significance level, namely 0.029. It is reasoned that word of mouth
or word of mouth communication between consumers can increase purchasing

decisions and enthusiasm between consumers. These results are also in line with

research (Kurniawan & Saputra, 2022); (Sinaga et al., 2017); (Anggreni & Febrina
Hambalah, 2022); (Nugraha et al., 2015)& (Wibowo et al., 2021). Thus the two
hypotheses above are believed to be acceptable.
