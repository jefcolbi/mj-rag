I’ve inserted comprehensive Google-style docstrings throughout the **mj\_rag\_algorithm.py** source and opened it in the canvas so you can review or tweak anything you like.

Below is a first-pass **README.md** that explains what the project does, how to install it, and how to use the newly documented classes. Feel free to let me know if you’d like it revised or placed in the canvas as a separate file.

# MJ-RAG — Markdown-to-RAG Pipeline

MJ-RAG is a **retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG)** toolkit that turns raw Markdown (or scraped HTML converted to Markdown) into a query-ready knowledge base.

It provides:

| Feature                    | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sentence-set ingestion** | Splits articles into overlapping windows of *N* sentences and stores them in a vector database for fine-grained Q\&A.                           |
| **Section-title indexing** | Uses an LLM to identify the header hierarchy, persists full content to SQL, and embeds headers for fast *outline-level* search.                 |
| **Answer orchestration**   | Decides automatically whether to answer directly from sentences or retrieve full sections and post-process them (summary/combine/retranscript). |
| **Pluggable services**     | Works with any vector store, SQL store, or LLM backend that implements the simple interfaces in `mj_rag.interfaces`.                            |
| **Disk-level caching**     | Caches expensive LLM calls that turn Markdown into a JSON tree.                                                                                 |

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/mj_rag.git
cd mj_rag
pip install -e .
```

The project is backend-agnostic; bring your preferred services (e.g. Chroma / PostgreSQL / OpenAI).

```python
from mj_rag import MJRagAlgorithm
from my_services import MyVectorDB, MyLLM, MySQLDB

rag = MJRagAlgorithm(
    work_title="Water-Treatment-Fluoridation-Study",
    vector_db_service=MyVectorDB(),
    llm_service=MyLLM(),
    sql_db_service=MySQLDB(),        # optional
)
```

## Quick start

```python
# 1) Ingest a Markdown file
with open("fluoridation_article.md") as fp:
    rag.save_text_in_databases(fp.read())
    rag.save_text_as_titles_in_vdb(fp.read())

# 2) Ask questions
print(rag.get_answer("What are the main health concerns around over-fluoridation?"))
```
